### What I learned

By attending this challenge, which was provided by Frontend Mentor, I was able to further improve my front end coding skillset, get used to writing my own code and learning the basic coding commands of both HTML and CSS.
Also, with every challenge, I am able to organize the coding components in a better and more logical way and also to create a better flow for all the content which will appear on the web page.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.add-to-cart {
  background-color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  width: 270px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 10px;
  height: 50px;
  margin-left: -30px;
  color: #fff;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.add-to-cart:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
  color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  background-color: #fff;
  border: 2px solid hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
}
```

### Continued development

Regarding my future coding experiences, I will continue focusing on HTML and CSS for now, until I have a better understanding of the two, as I am only beggining my coding journey. After mastering these two, I will most likely focus my attention on JavaScript and further improve my front-end coding skills.
